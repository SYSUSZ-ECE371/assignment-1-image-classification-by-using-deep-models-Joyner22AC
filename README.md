# README

This project contains two folders: **Ex1** and **Ex2**.

---

## Ex1

This folder contains files for fine-tuning the ResNet-50 model for flower classification using the MMPretrain framework.

Files included:

- `resnet50_flower`: Model configuration file  
- `data_split.py`: Dataset splitting script  
- `20250513_202939.log`: Training log  
- `resnet50_8xb32_in1k.py`: Base configuration file inherited from MMPretrain  

The fine-tuned model weights file `epoch_10.pth` was originally included, but due to its large size, it is not pushed to the repository. You can download it from the following link:
